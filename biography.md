Skyconqueror is a straight heavy metal band founded in the surroundings of Münster (North Western Germany) in early 1997 by Hellduke and Messiah Of Evil. Shortly after Mayhem became part of the band as the bassist and Nick Grave followed as the lead singer.

In January 1998 the debut demo CD “STREAK OF LIGHTNING” with five songs was recorded by Carlos Silva at the Subsonic Studio in Rheine and was released a few weeks later. In February 1998 the first gig was played at the Silmarillion in Werne in front of a crowd of 100 crazy headbangers.

A couple of gigs followed until the first show in the new line up was performed in July 2000 at the self-organized “Summer Metal Meeting” in Nordkirchen: Demondawn (Vocals), Carnage (Guitar), Hellduke, Mayhem and Messiah Of Evil.

In September of the same year the second 6-song-demo-CD “SILVER HAZE RISING” was recorded again by Carlos Silva.

The third demo CD „FORGED IN HELL“ – self-recorded in 2002 – contained six songs in the spirit of NWOBHM.

Chris left the band at the end of 2004, and SKYCONQUEROR continued as an unholy four piece. At the end of 2006 two new songs were recorded at Luna Studio in Lüdinghausen by Dieter Steffan for a compilation containing a variety of different music styles.

In March 2008 the “HELLSTORY” CD was also recorded at Luna Studio, containing twelve songs from the last ten years. This lethal dose of metal emerged from the pits of hell in June of 2008.

The following years the band gave several infernal gigs, took part in the movie “Fate and Destruction”, found new inspiration and collected a lot of material. The eleven songs of the new CD “UNDER THE PENTAGRAM” were recorded from December 2012 until March 2014 in “The Crypt”-Studio out there in the dark and mysterious landscape of the wild Westfalian countryside.

Hellduke left the band in August 2014, after which Nick Grave - who had been the singer in the early days - joined again as new bass player. Mayhem, who already had contributed a couple of guitar tracks to UNDER THE PENTAGRAM, switched to play lead and rhythm guitar.

The band has moved to Dortmund Nordstadt to occupy a place for rehearsals there. At that place they are currently recording the successor to UNDER THE PENTAGRAM...
