1997 – current

Skyconqueror is a straight heavy metal band founded in the surroundings of Münster (North
Western Germany) in early 1997 by Jan Tappert and Carsten Stiens. Shortly after Mirko
Jankord became part of the band as the bassist and Niko Saloustros followed as the lead
singer.

In January 1998 the debut demo CD "STREAK OF LIGHTNING" with five songs was
recorded by Carlos Silva at the Subsonic Studio in Rheine and was released a few weeks
later.

In February 1998 the first gig was played at the Silmarillion in Werne in front of a crowd of
100 crazy headbangers. A couple of gigs followed until the first show in the new line up was
performed in July 2000 at the self-organized “Summer Metal Meeting” in Nordkirchen: Daniel
Hiller (Vocals), Christian Kahlau (Guitar), Jan, Mirko and Carsten.
In September of the same year the second 6-song-demo-CD "SILVER HAZE RISING" was
recorded again by Carlos Silva.

The third demo CD „FORGED IN HELL“ – self-recorded in 2002 – contained six songs in the
spirit of NWOBHM.

Chris left the band at the end of 2004, and SKYCONQUEROR continued as an unholy four
piece. At the end of 2006 two new songs were recorded at Luna Studio in Lüdinghausen by
Dieter Steffan for a compilation containing a variety of different music styles.
In March 2008 the "HELLSTORY" CD was also recorded at Luna Studio, containing twelve
songs from the last ten years. This lethal dose of metal emerged from the pits of hell in June
of 2008.

The following years the band gave several infernal gigs, took part in the movie “Fate and
Destruction”, found new inspiration and collected a lot of material.
The eleven songs of the new CD "UNDER THE PENTAGRAM" were recorded from
December 2012 until March 2014 in “The Crypt”-Studio out there in the dark and mysterious
landscape of the wild Westfalian countryside.

The CD has been released on July 2nd 2014, it was well received all over the world.

In 2015 Niko Saloustros joined again as new bass player. Mirko switched to play lead and rhythm
guitar. Since then the band has played several gigs all over germany.
