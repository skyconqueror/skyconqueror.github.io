            SKYCONQUEROR is a traditional heavy metal band founded in 1997 in the countryside near Münster. During the first years they released three demos - their first album HELLSTORY was released after more than a decade in spring of 2008.
        </p><p>

            In the following years the band played live and collected material. The second album UNDER THE PENTAGRAM was released in Summer of 2014.
        </p><p>

            SKYCONQUEROR has had a stable lineup since 2014. Nick Grave plays bass guitar, Mayhem plays lead and rhythm guitars, lead vocals are performed by Demondawn and drums are tormented by Messiah Of Evil.
        </p><p>

            SKYCONQUEROR rehearses in Dortmund Nordstadt for quite a while now. There they recorded their most recent output - the EP THE BLACK RAVEN - which was released in February of 2023. THE BLACK RAVEN received several positive reviews both live and in the press, including Rock Hard and Deaf Forever.

            The release of THE BLACK RAVEN earned SKYCONQUEROR gigs on the German Swordbrothers and the Spirit Of Metal Festival, where they have shared the stage with ATLANTEAN KODEX, TYGERS OF PAN TANG, TYTAN and KEV RIDDLES BAPHOMET to name a few.
        </p><p>
            Currently SKYCONQUEROR is working on new songs for their next release - most likely an album length this time. Also they test their new material on the audience - and they are actively searching for opportunities to do so.
        </p><p>
            SKYCONQUEROR plays traditional heavy metal inspired by the occult both lyrically and musically.
