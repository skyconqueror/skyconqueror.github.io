            Skyconqueror is a traditional heavy metal band founded in 1997 in the countryside near Münster. Over the course of the first six years they released three demos - the first full length CD HELLSTORY was released after more than a decade in spring of 2008.

            In the following years the band played live and collected material. The second full length CD UNDER THE PENTAGRAM was released in Summer of 2014.

            The band has had a stable lineup since 2014. Nick Grave plays bass, Mayhem plays lead and rhythm guitars, lead vocals are performed by Demondawn and drums are tormented by Messiah Of Evil.
