* Old Mother Hell
* CROM
* SKYCONQUEROR and
* Servants To The Tide

It is really an honour to play this one, since [GERMAN SWORDBROTHERS FESTIVAL] has a long tradition of serving you great Heavy Metal bands! This is already the ninth time this festival has been organized, so mark your calendars for the 11.03.2023!
