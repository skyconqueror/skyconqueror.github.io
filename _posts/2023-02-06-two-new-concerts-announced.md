Over the weekend we have been confirmed to play another two concerts this year!

## GERMAN SWORDBROTHERS FESTIVAL

We are going to play the [GERMAN SWORDBROTHERS FESTIVAL] on 11.03.2023 this year at the Lükaz in Lünen. It will be a hell of a ride, since the billing is really awesome:

* Atlantean Kodex
* Stormburner
* Old Mother Hell
* CROM
* SKYCONQUEROR and
* Servants To The Tide.

It is really an honour to play this one, since [GERMAN SWORDBROTHERS FESTIVAL] has a long tradition of serving you great Heavy Metal bands! This is already the ninth time this festival has been organized, so mark your calendars for the 11.03.2023!

## TELLERROCK

Also our friends from TELLERROCK festival have invited us to play there once again! Everyone who knows how to get the ticket, be quick to order one of those, since they are limited and have sold out within few days after presale has started.

Lineup is not yet finalized, all we know is that the [SEWER LADS] from Münster will join us playing there!

*Please note that TELLERROCK is private and invite only!*
